       <h2>Description</h2>

       <p>Carne asada, which in English means "grilled meat," is beef. For this Mexican dish, one-inch-thick steaks
         are marinated in lime juice and seasonings, grilled, 
        and then cut into thin strips. Carne asada is either
         served as a main course typically with rice and beans, or 
         used as a filling for tacos or burritos.</p>

         <h2>Ingredients</h2>
         <ul>
            <Li> ½ cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves </Li>

            <Li>⅓ cup olive oil </Li>
            <Li>¼ cup reduced sodium soy sauce</Li>
            <Li>¼ cup freshly squeezed orange juice</Li>
            <Li>2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice</Li>
            <Li>4 cloves garlic, minced</Li>
            <Li>1 jalapeno, seeded and diced</Li>
            <Li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</Li>
            <Li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</Li>
            <Li>1 ½ pounds flank steak</Li>

         </ul>
         <h2>Steps</h2>
         <ol>
           <li>In a medium bowl, combine cilantro, olive oil, soy sauce, orange juice, lime juice, garlic, jalapeno, cumin and 1 teaspoon pepper; set aside 1/2 cup of the mixture in the refrigerator until ready to serve.</li>
            <li> In a gallon size Ziploc bag or large bowl, combine steak and remaining cilantro mixture; marinate for at least 4 hours to overnight, turning the bag occasionally. Drain the steak from the marinade.</li>
            <li>Preheat grill to medium high heat. Using paper towels, pat both sides of the steak dry; season with salt and pepper, to taste.</li>
            <li>Add steak to grill, and cook, flipping once, until desired doneness, about 6 minutes per side for medium rare. Let rest 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Thinly slice steak against the grain and serve with reserved 1/2 cup cilantro mixture.</li>
         </ol>
